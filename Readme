### Database Setup
1. Add your DATABASE config file into "./application/includes/env_properties"
   ```
   exemple: ./application/includes/env_properties/db_conf.php
   ```
   
   ```
    <?php

      $ENVIRONMENT    = "development";
      $DB_HOST        = "";
      $DB_USER        = "";
      $DB_PASSWORD    = "";
      $DATABASE       = "";
      $BASE_URL       = "";
   ```
   
2. Call your DATABASE config file in variable $ENV_PROPERTY_FILE from "./application/includes/properties.php"
  
   ```
    <?php
    
      $ENV_PROPERTY_FILE = "env_properties/db_conf.php";

      include_once $ENV_PROPERTY_FILE;
      
   ```
